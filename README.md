# WITR Discord Bot

this was made as a shitpost at a random point but like it actually works. (except when it doesnt)

## Why 2 bots?

Well discord doesn't allow a bot to connect to 2 different Voice channels in a discord server so EVIL WITR Bot is for the UDG Stream only

## ENV stuff

Bot keys are available in 1Pass
`.env.example` is the current env vars

## Where is this
located on the `witr-workflows` vm in `/bin/WITR-Discord-Bot`
services are `EvilWITRBot` and `WITRBot` respectively
